# Getting Started with ObjectOS

ObjectOS is a high-performance, metadata-driven low-code runtime engine.

## Core Concepts

- **Kernel**: The brain of the operation.
- **Drivers**: How we talk to databases.
- **Server**: Exposing APIs over HTTP.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @objectos/kernel @objectos/server
```

## Quick Start

Initialize the kernel and register your first object.
